/*
In this file, you'll define the fundamental building blocks of your language: its tokens.
This involves declaring all the TokenType constants (like IDENT, INT, PLUS, VAR, PRINT, etc.),
defining the Token struct to hold a token's type and its literal value, and implementing the New
helper function to create tokens. Crucially, you'll also populate the keywords map and implement
the LookupIdent function, which will allow your lexer to distinguish between general identifiers
and reserved keywords like var and print.
